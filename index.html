                        Hey there! My name's Sam, I'm a rising senior at Stanford currently enjoying a gap year. This site serves as my first foray into web dev, and is very much a work in progress. I appreciate you checking it out, follow along as it becomes much more interesting/aesthetic in the coming months. <br><br>

                        In the meantime, feel free catch me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/samspinner">LinkedIn</a>.
